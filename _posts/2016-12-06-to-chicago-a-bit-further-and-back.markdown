*A glimpse at Google Headquarters*

I was standing in the middle of it. I couldn’t believe it. Could you blame me? I wanted to go there for like 5 or more years. And here it was, pretty epic stuff! But let’s start from the beginning, shall we?

# Can You Really Do It?

So what is this all about? Is it that hard to visit the valley? Not at all! Well, maybe it is hard if you need a Visa to visit the states. Yep, living in a relatively unknown country can be both great and a hiccup at times. Truth be told, it wasn't that hard to obtain a tourist Visa. So I won't bother you with the details.

# Ready. Set. Fly.

The flight from Sofia to Amsterdam and finally Toronto was living within minutes. I can't describe how exciting that was. Fast forward a bit (it felt like 2 days), we were landing in Toronto. No problems at the border.

*Look at that view!*

The flight was ok. Someone was waiting for us at the airport and drove us right to a cute house in the suburbs of Toronto. I went to bed totally exhausted a few hours later.

On the next day, we visited the downtown. Hopped on the CN tower and enjoyed an amazing view. A quick walk around gave us a sample of what downtown Toronto was all about. It looked pretty cool, actually.

I had a lot of prejudices about the food in North America. I thought it was pretty bad. Well, nothing was further from the truth. The grocery stores were filled with amazing fruits, veggies and meat. A couple of fast food restaurants were offering decent meals with salads, grilled meat, beans etc. I was hungry pretty much the whole time, so I tried a lot of the stuff :)

*The island near Toronto. Peace & beautiful nature.*

On the next day, we visited the downtown again. This time, only to board a ferry to the Island near Toronto. The weather was nice, not very warm though. Just a long walk without much tourists. Pure joy ride with beautiful nature all around us. And yes, we walked on the grass!

#### Niagara Falls

*Can you believe this is real?*

We went to the Niagara Falls and it was simply amazing! Just go there and make sure you are on the Canadian side!

# New York, New York...

Our flight from Toronto to NYC went ok. The duration was more like three hours rather than the estimated one. That didn't matter much, we were in the USA! Again, no problems at the border.

We rented a place at 117th via Airbnb for 6 nights. Now, the trip from La Guardia to 117th wasn't as smooth as one might expect. The bus stopped us somewhere at 118th, yet we had to pick up keys from a key cafe. The address was wrong, though. We contacted our host. He gave us a new address and rented Uber for us. Running around 125th and it's surroundings at night (with luggage) wasn't the best experience of my life. We got it everything in check and soon enough felt the comfort of the bed. 

#### Central Park

*Good morning, sunshine!*

Today was a good day (at Central Park). NYC didn't dissapoint. Central Park was pretty huge (as far as parks in big cities go) and widely diverse. We spent something like 4 hours in it, just the first day. So much to enjoy there. As soon as we reached the Downtown things changed a bit as we were entering...

# L.A.

We arrived pretty late and had to return the car we rented. The drop zone was LAX and the traffic was horrific. My first drive in the USA had pretty stressful end. But it was ok after all.

We filled up the car right before leaving it and used a shuttle to the airport. The question was how to get to downtown from there? We asked around and a shuttle service was offered to us. What a mistake! The ticket was 17$ and we waited for like an hour before a shuttle to downtown arrived. After a good hour later we were in front of our hotel (something more like a motel...). Lesson learned: use Uber or Lyft for LAX <-> Downtown. I believe it would've been cheaper and faster.

*Just another sunny day in Cali*


On the next day, I was waiting to see a police vehicle. There was this song that was spinning in my head. Over and over again. Yes, it originated from Campton.

Downtown L.A. was pretty much meh... Lots of homeless and mentally ill people were all around. Pretty sad picture... We went to Union Station to confirm our bus station for Las Vegas. While there were some amazing sights along the way...

*Somebody was already taking a shower!*

There was this park (and surroundings) right next to Union Station, filled with homeless people. It was like nobody was seeing them. Huh, was that ok!? Nope! It really felt like a 3rd world country in there.

Later, we decided to visit the big park above Holywood right about when the sunset was starting it looked like this:

# Vegas (Huh? Never thought I was into gambling...)

The only reason we visited Vegas was the Grand Canyon. You can tell I was pretty skeptical about the trip. There were few surprises along the way, though.

Our bus dropped us something like 5+ km from our hotel. There were literally no people around. It was Vegas, there should be people everywhere, right? 

We only had one backpack. So, we took a walk through some parts of Vegas. It was a walk among so many homeless people. In Vegas!?

*I always thought that the first person I see was going to be someone else*

Well, someone was definitely there to welcome us :) He was pretty cute, too!

*Say hi to Skipper. And don't mind my torn sneaker, please!*

IndyCar was in town and that was a little bonus along the way:

*The early retirement was most probably caused by a poor choice of sponsor*

Finally, we checked in our hotel and were ready for exploration.
